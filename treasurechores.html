		<p>Treasure Chore is a parent/child application that helps children to learn how to be responsible and helps teach them the important everyday chores in a fun way. Parents have a portal where they are able to assign chores to their children and keep track of their progress, and grant rewards for their hard work. On the children side they have a fun game and story that goes along with their completion of chores, and they also earn and save up coins in order to purchase rewards. The concept of this helped to fuel the idea of a pirate themed app due to the reward system and search for more &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; or more rewards by completing more &ldquo;obstacles&rdquo; or tasks.</p>

		<p class="about-section">These are some of the more developed thumbnails I had for the logo. I wanted to make it fun for the child demographic. I also included the theme of pirates and treasure into the sketch. This was a difficult process when making sure to create something interesting for kids but also remembering that parents will be looking at the app as well so I would need something they would be attracted to.</p>

	<p class="about-section">For the children's version of the app, I focused it on being on a landscape iPad format due to the amount of information they would have on the screen. To keep the child interested in using the app, I made an adventure and pirate theme with stories and incentives.</p>

	<p class="about-section">These are screenshots of the parent side of the app. This version of the app would be based on a typical vertical phone screen since that is something parents would use more often. There isn't as many colors as the children's app to appeal to the parents. The typefaces are changed to fit a more mature audience rather than the rounded edge used in the children's version. Keeping track of the children's progress is the focus of this app. It is used to assign chores to the children, make sure they are keeping up, and set the rewards that they can receive.</p>
